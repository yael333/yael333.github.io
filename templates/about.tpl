      welcome to my digital grimoire! i'm a young witch in training, a cybersec enthusiast, and an avid supporter of free software. i'm also a firm believer in the power of cats, music, and esotericism - because let's be real, who doesn't love a good dose of magic in their lives?

      as you wander through my website, you'll find that most of my work is self-driven, with a focus on linux, cybersecurity, and retro computing.<br><br>
      some of my current programming interests at the momemnt are:<br>
      ~ binary exploitation (kernel level specifically)<br>
      ~ windows internals and malware (Ü< VX >Ü)<br>
      ~ functional programming<br>
      ~ (un-)typed lambda calculus and other minimal forms of computation<br>
      ~ personal computing (uxn, plan9front, haiku...)<br>
      <br>
