        <p>One of the most undeniable and topics concern with Microsoft's smash hit Windows is the bloat in software and features. It is a focal point point in malware targeting, abusing poorly designed systems and preying on it's huge userbase.</p>
<p>All of it undeniably ties in into The Browser Wars Microsoft found themselves in, all tech corps trying to shill their spyware packaged with an open-source web browser engine. Besides my serious non important opinions on the matter, I think we're all familiar with Internet Explorer, an old piece of tech that still comes packaged on all Windows systems and is damn near impossible to get rid off.</p>
<p>Per usual, let's try to abuse the fact it is so atomic to Window's user experience and try to achieve some sort of malware persistence.
I opened procmon from the sysinternals utilities suite looking for potential DLL injections, in the case IE tries to load non existent / or creates it's own DLLs we're able to intervene and load our "malicious" ones.<br />
Using these filters, we can look for specific kinds of DLLs that only exist on runtime:</p>
