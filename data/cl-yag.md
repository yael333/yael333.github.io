I commonly fall for what i call "Website Envy" - looking at other's awesome sites and wanting mine to be just like that. So here's a post detailing exactly that!

## A Cyberspace
Recently I've tapped into the gopherspace, geminiverse and the World Wide Web as well. So many fun, interesting and downrigh beautiful webpages.
I was always in favor of static generated websites, with no backend and little as of effort on the clientside and discovering a whole slew of pages pushing that agenda with great content has just opened my eyes.

## cl-yag
My last website was built with [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), a static site generator written and operating in Haskell. It's a great piece of software that highlights the declartive nature of functionl programming and how to leverage it using real applications. In my adventures I came across [Solene's site](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/), a great hub of general computing, OpenBSD and NixOS. It's design was minimal and elegant, yet robust enough to host plenty of content.

I decided to take her project ``cl-yag`` and use it for my own site - after a bit of lisp hacks it is now complete. You're probably reading on it right now as well (Apologies reader futures after the inevitable changes).

## Gopher & Gemini
These protocols were first class requirements for my new website, although as of right now I don't have a gopher or a gemini server running there's full support for it. I can't wait to join y'all in a bit~

## Thoughts
The modern web has consumed and taken from us so much, but I'm so happy there's a niche for this still. I absolutely adore this kind of stuff and I'm glad I could add my website to this niche in the cyberspace.
