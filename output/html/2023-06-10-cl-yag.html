  <p>I commonly fall for what i call &#8220;Website Envy&#8221; - looking at other&#8217;s awesome sites and wanting mine to be just like that. So here&#8217;s a post detailing exactly that!</p>

<h2 id="acyberspace">A Cyberspace</h2>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve tapped into the gopherspace, geminiverse and the World Wide Web as well. So many fun, interesting and downrigh beautiful webpages.
I was always in favor of static generated websites, with no backend and little as of effort on the clientside and discovering a whole slew of pages pushing that agenda with great content has just opened my eyes.</p>

<h2 id="cl-yag">cl-yag</h2>

<p>My last website was built with <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>, a static site generator written and operating in Haskell. It&#8217;s a great piece of software that highlights the declartive nature of functionl programming and how to leverage it using real applications. In my adventures I came across <a href="https://dataswamp.org/~solene/">Solene&#8217;s site</a>, a great hub of general computing, OpenBSD and NixOS. It&#8217;s design was minimal and elegant, yet robust enough to host plenty of content.</p>

<p>I decided to take her project <code>cl-yag</code> and use it for my own site - after a bit of lisp hacks it is now complete. You&#8217;re probably reading on it right now as well (Apologies reader futures after the inevitable changes).</p>

<h2 id="gophergemini">Gopher &amp; Gemini</h2>

<p>These protocols were first class requirements for my new website, although as of right now I don&#8217;t have a gopher or a gemini server running there&#8217;s full support for it. I can&#8217;t wait to join y&#8217;all in a bit~</p>

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>

<p>The modern web has consumed and taken from us so much, but I&#8217;m so happy there&#8217;s a niche for this still. I absolutely adore this kind of stuff and I&#8217;m glad I could add my website to this niche in the cyberspace.</p>
