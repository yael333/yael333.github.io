  <p>Over the years of my CTF&#8217;ing I always come back to <a href="https://pwnable.kr">pwnable.kr</a>, although a tad outdated it&#8217;s a vast source of simply awesome binary exploitation and pwn challanges. In particular their kernel exploitation series of challanges interest me - they&#8217;re really well made and good introductory material on the matter. Per the policies on the site, this writeup won&#8217;t share any source code and try to be minimal as possible.</p>

<p>The last of those challanges is <em>softmmu</em>, here&#8217;s the readme:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>If you are good at kernel exploit, try this one :)</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="./static/img/softmmu/softmmu.png" style="width:20%"></p>

<h2 id="thechallange">The Challange</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re given two things: a linux kernel object file containing some sort of a driver, and access to a fairly old linux virtual machine loaded with asid driver. Before we open the executable for further inspection in IDA, let&#8217;s SSH into the machine and check what it does.</p>

<pre><code class="shell">...
[+] Loading x86 PAE MMU emulator
[+] Write the virtual address to /proc/softmmu
[+] You can obtain it's physical address by reading /proc/softmmu
[+] i.e. echo -ne 'x00x80x04x08' &gt; /proc/softmmu; hexdump -C /proc/softmmu
[+] Let the kernel exploit begin :)

$ uname -a
Linux (none) 3.7.1 #1 SMP Mon Dec 23 06:07:19 PST 2013 i686 GNU/Linux
$ ls /*.ko
/softmmu.ko
</code></pre>

<p><em>Hmm</em>, it prints out a pretty explanation for us :3 As the name softmmu hints - the module interfaces with the Linux kernel memory&#8217;s and emulates a x86 Page Address Extension for the MMU. The interface with the module seems to be very straightforward, we write a virtual address to the device file /proc/softmmu and then read back the physical address.</p>

<h2 id="findingavulnerability">Finding A Vulnerability</h2>

<p>Our end goal is to get root, so we definitely have to find a vulnerability to expoloit in the softmmu module. Let&#8217;s open the kernel object file in IDA to analyze:</p>

<p><img src="./static/img/softmmu/overview.png" style="width:70%"></p>

<p>A fairly tame program, not too many functions and fairly straightforward structure. We are not going to reverse the entire program (since I found the vulnerability quickly) but here are some pointers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We cannot request the physical addresses of ones outside userspace (seems important for the exploit).
It recursively traverses page table within the mmu_walk() function in order to retrieve addresses.
Program contains verbose output for debugging purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last point is particulary important; it allows us to understand the inner workings better and perhaps find a vulnerability to exploit, let&#8217;s look at the debugging code.</p>

<pre><code class="c">__int64 __usercall get_pte_entry@&lt;edx:eax&gt;(int a1@&lt;eax&gt;, char *a2@&lt;edx&gt;)
{
  int v2; // ebx

  v2 = *(_DWORD *)&amp;a2[8 * ((a1 &amp; 0x1FF000u) &gt;&gt; 12)];
  if ( (v2 &amp; 1) != 0 )
  {
    printk(&quot;[Debug] PGD(%x) Dumpn&quot;, a2);
    printk(
      &quot;[task:%s] %p:%02x %p:%02x %p:%02x %p:%02xn&quot;,
      (const char *)(__readfsdword((unsigned int)&amp;current_task) + 740),
      a2,
      *a2,
      a2 + 1,
      a2[1],
      a2 + 2,
      a2[2],
      a2 + 3,
      a2[3]);
    printk(&quot;[Debug] Dump Virtual Addressn&quot;);
    printk(&quot;n===============================n&quot;);
    printk((const char *)req_vaddr);
    printk(&quot;n===============================n&quot;);
  }
  return v2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Fairly bloaty raw decompiled code, but breaking it down it is very simple: it retrieves a page table entry from a PD64 (Page Global Directory entry). Besides the pretty cool kernel level code, the vulnerability here is glaringly obvious - the program passes the address we request (a global variable) to printk().</p>

<blockquote>
<p>printk((const char *)req_vaddr);</p>

<p>We found a string format vulnerability we can control :3 </p>

<h2 id="writingtheexploit-pt.1">Writing The Exploit - Pt. 1</h2>

<p>So far this hasn&#8217;t been a challenge for kernel experts, even a script kiddie can find this vulnerability. I must admit, writing the exploit is much more difficult because a plethora of reasons.</p>

<p>In order to pass a string to the module, we&#8217;d have to allocate some bytes in the process memory space. Let&#8217;s try compile a simple C program on the remote machine to do just that:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">/tmp $ gcc pwn.c
sh: gcc: not found
</code></pre>

<p><em>Oof</em>, that means we have to cross compile.
The first problem that imposes us is the fact the remote machine is running a really outdated version of the kernel, paired with the fact it doesn&#8217;t have internet access it really limits us in how we compile for it.
The soltuion that I came up with was as follows
compile a static no-stdlib program -&gt; compress it -&gt; base64 the tar.gz -&gt; do the reverse on remote.</p>

<h4 id="thismeanswritingaminimallibcfromscratchgoodluckme...">This means writing a minimal libc from scratch, <em>good luck me</em>&#8230;</h4>

<p>After a fair amount of work, I got to a level where I had all of the necessary API&#8217;s to leverage the vulnerability
On local machine:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">yael@covenstead:~/softmmu$ gcc pwn.c -nostdlib -m32 -static -o /dev/stdout | gzip - | base64 -w 0

<p>On Remote:</p>

<p>OMG, it worked and we wrote into the process name &lt;3! (As seen in the debug messages) All of this work wasn&#8217;t for nothing.</p>

<h2 id="writingtheexploit-pt.2">Writing The Exploit - Pt. 2</h2>

<p>Now for the second part of the exploit, we have to figure out how the hell we take advantage of the format string vulnerability. This isn&#8217;t like the average format string attack as it&#8217;s not performed on a userland stack, but a kernel one. Besides our request address which occasionally surfaces down the stack we get nada.</p>

<p>Luckily for us we have a bunch of debug values on the stack, some of them might be incredibly useful to craft an exploit. <strong><em>Yes!</em></strong> The stack is setup in a way we can write to the page table entry any arbtriary value we want, hence we change the permissions of a kernel pages and execute our code as supervisor :3
(We have a pointer for each byte and the corresponding address)</p>

<p>Since we have to fully comperhend the paging mechanism in full detail to execute this exploit properly, here&#8217;s a diagram of the Page Table Entry structure:</p>

<p><img src="./static/img/softmmu/pte.png" style="width:70%"></p>

<p>There are many bits and flops, but assuming basic knowledge of paging nothing is too out of ordinary. The first three flags are interesting: P (<strong>P</strong>resent), R/W (<strong>R</strong>ead/<strong>W</strong>rite) and U/S (<strong>U</strong>ser/<strong>S</strong>upervisor).
If the <strong>P</strong>resent bit is set then the page is actually in physical memory at the moment, if the <strong>R</strong>ead and <strong>W</strong>rite bit is set then the page is both readable and writable (if not then it is read only) and lastly the <strong>U</strong>Ser/<strong>S</strong>upervisor bit is set based on privellege level.</p>

<p>We can get to work on patching the bytes of the PTE, we are able to patch one of our userspace page entries to pount to a physical adress that contains the kernel code of sys_setresuid() and make it writable. Once we got that we can flip the prillege check from je to jne, call setresuid(0) and obtain root &gt;:3</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>This without a doubt is a serious challenge full of hurdles. Personally for me it symbolizes some sort of maturity in my cybersecurity journey, I learned so much throughout and I can&#8217;t wait to do more.</p>

<p>About the softmmu itself, this post only showed the a small part of the failures. So much stuff I first tried didn&#8217;t end up working at the end, this only shows how deep and complex it gets. I believe it is a prime example of diving deep and reading old documentation about the kernel&#8217;s inner workings and trying to figure it all out.</p>

<p><img src="./static/img/softmmu/softmmu_completed.png" style="width:20%"></p>

<p>TLDR: the kernel is complex</p>
