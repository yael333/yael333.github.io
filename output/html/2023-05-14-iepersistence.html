  <p>One of the controversial concerns with Microsoft's smash hit Windows is the bloat in software and features. It is a focal point point in malware targeting, abusing poorly designed systems and preying on it's huge userbase.</p>

<p>All of it undeniably ties in into The Browser Wars Microsoft found themselves in, all tech corps trying to shill their spyware packaged with an open-source web browser engine. Besides my serious non important opinions on the matter, I think we're all familiar with Internet Explorer, an old piece of tech that still comes packaged on all Windows systems and is damn near impossible to get rid off.</p>

<p>Per usual, let's try to abuse the fact it is so atomic to Window's user experience and try to achieve some sort of malware persistence.
I opened procmon from the sysinternals utilities suite looking for potential DLL injections, in the case IE tries to load non existent / or creates it&#8217;s own DLLs we&#8217;re able to intervene and load our &#8220;malicious&#8221; ones.
Using these filters, we can look for specific kinds of DLLs that only exist on runtime:</p>

<p>Let's open the executable and observe :3</p>

<figure>
<img src="./static/img/iepersistence/launch.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>So many... We need to look for files that are used exclusively by IE, one that came up that has a readable and non suspicious name is suspend.dll.</p>

<p>Here's a &quot;malicious&quot; DLL we can use to emulate code execution needed for persistence, a real malware would hide here persistent code.</p>

<pre><code class="c">#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &quot;pch.h&quot;
#pragma comment (lib, &quot;user32.lib&quot;)

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule, DWORD  ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved) {
    switch (ul_reason_for_call) {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
        MessageBox(
            NULL,
            L&quot;you just got pwned~&quot;,
            L&quot;/ᐠ. ᴗ.ᐟ\\ﾉ&quot;,
            MB_OK
        );
        break;
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
        break;
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}

</code></pre>

<p>Time for compilation, I will use Visual Studio's built in solutions although it is fairly flexible.
After it's done, we need to put it where IE loads it from and rename it to solution.dll:</p>

<img src="./static/img/iepersistence/pwn.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="wowwegotourpwn">WOW, we got our pwn~</h3>

<p>Our code got executed and then Internet Explorer launched per normal. This is pretty pretty cool...</p>

<p><em>What can we take away from this?</em> </p>

<p>While this particular proof of concept has been patched somewhere last year, I believe it holds a lot of relevancy in practices of persistence and malware design as a whole.
Looking for fundemental features Microsoft doesn&#8217;t want to get rid off (nor can't) and find flaws in their behaviour is a cornerstone in this field. In addition, DLL injection in this way is incredibly simple yet demonstrates understanding of Windows Internals.</p>
